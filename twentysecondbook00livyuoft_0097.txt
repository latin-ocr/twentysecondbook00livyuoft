maynoe partis. ‘⁸ Of a great portion‚’' i.e. of tho Roman army.

Fuere quos. ‘⁸ Some.’' Lina-any, ‘⁶ there were those, whom.” Observe

’ that a tl·ird person sing. or plur. of a tense of sum is at times (as here)

joined to some case of qui, and the two together form a periphrasis for
that case of aliquis which corresponds to the case of qui. Here sucre,

nos=aliquos. In reality there is in this construction an ellipse of tho
demonstrative pron. forming the Subjeet of the tense of sum ; ey. here,
of ii before fuere—nando. Gerund in do, used as abl. of “manner''
after capessere [5 141, 4].—impulerit. After all indefinite, or general,

See note on quantam maa-inmm vastitatem, ch. 3 5 6.

Super cetera. “Besides the rest of the things.”——⁸i tradidissent.
“If they shall have delivered up.'' As the subj. has no future 01
its own. this defleiency is supplied by its other tenses; the present
and imperfect supplying the place of the simple future, the per-
fect and pluperfect that of the future perfect. Hence, when future time
is spoken of in the leading clause, one of the above tenses will be em-
ployed in the dependent elause; but which of them will be determined
b) the leading verb of the proposition, and also by the consideration
whether the future action is to be regarded as complete or not—abire.
Snppl ros (=R0manos) as Subjeet.—passurum. Supply essa—que Pun-
icci r iyione servata fides. “And this promise was kept with Punic (or
cauthaginian) scrupulousness.’' Quoe, refers to the clause, si arma . . . .
passurum, but is in concord with fides by atti-action [ᾗ 159 . The Car-
thaginians were regarded by the Romans as notorious y fa e ansl trea-
cherous, so that Punicafides is equivaleuttomala fides orfraus. Fides is
here nsedin the force of ‘¹ scrupulonsness ”in keepingan oath or one's word.
