consuls together, 13.c. 219. Both of them were sent against the Inyx-iaus
who had risen in arms. At the end of the campaign they obtained a
triumph, but were shortly afterwards brought to trial on a charge of
having made an unfair division of the spoil amongst the soldiery.
Livius was condemned, as it would seem, most unjustly3 and so grieved
was he at the disgrace inflicted upon him, that he retired to his estate in
the country, never afterwards taking part in public affairs. Paulus
escaped with difficulty. Hence the term presently applied to him

OHAPTER XXXV11.—Ccedem. From this point to yentes at end of

‘¹ agent.’'—-—qu‹e=et haec.—se=Hz'eronem.—Patre3 conscriptos. Origin-
ally the name Patres designated those who in the earliest days of Rome
were appointed members of the highest council of the State. It was
given to them either in reference to their age, or from the paternal care
they exercised for the public welfare. Moreover, Con-scripti (subst.)
was the name primarily given to such Romans as were appointed mem-
bers of the Senate by Brutus, after the expulsion of Tar-quin the Proud,
to supply the place of those whom that king had put to death. It was
vemployed because their names were written with, or enrolled among,
those of the older members. According to Livy, Book 2, ch. 1, when
the Senate was convened, the Patres and the Conscripli were summoned
as distinct and separate members of that body. Eventually, however,
the two names came to be applied to Senators generally. and Conscripti
is now commonly regarded and rendered as an adj. forming the attribu-
tive of Patres. ‘¹ Conscript Fathers.”

that in Oratio Obliqua a pres. or imperf. subjunctive is employed where
in Oratio Recta the imperative would be used. The tense of the sub·
junctive depends upon whether the leading verb speaks of present or
past time. Here the leading verb, which governs the whole, is nuntia-
runt, which speaks of past time; hence the imperf. subj. is used-accip-
erent: had nuntiat boen used, then, instead of acciperent Livy would
