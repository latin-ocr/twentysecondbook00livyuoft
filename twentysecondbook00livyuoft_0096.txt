each cohort into three maniples ; and each maniple into two centuries.
Snpposing, therefore, that there were one hundred men in each century
——as the name would imply—a legion would hence have consisted of six
thousand men. This, however, was not the case, the number varying
from time to time. To each legion three hundred cavalry were usually
attached, and these were divided into ten turmoe or “troops’' and each
turma into three decuriae, i.e. bodies of ten men. The infantry of a
legion were of three kinds: the hastati, principes, and triarii. The
hastati, ἵζε. “spearmen,” were so called from their being originally
armed with a hasta, or spear, which weapon was after a time laid aside
as inconvenient in use. They consisted of young men in the flower of
life, and formed the first line in battle. Next to them were posted the
principes, who anciently, as their name—“ the first men ’'-implies,
occupied the front line. These were men of middle age and in the full
vigour of life. The triarii—‘¹ men of the third line '’—eame last.
These were old soldiers of tried valour. Anciently they were termed
piloni, is. “ men of the pilum, orjavelin‚” with which they were provided,
while the hastati and principes, who were drawn up before them. were
called ante-pilam, i.e. “ those before the pilarziff'

was cognisant or could state as a fact, but* as something which was
commonly reported, or which he had heard. but was unable to vouch
for its truth. In contradistinction to this it may be observcd thatin
fuit, prostravit, avertit, invexit, he denis with what he accepts as facts.
