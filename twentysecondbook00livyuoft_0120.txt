patronos. In order that the patricians and plebeians might be connected
together by the strictest bonds‚ Romulus ordained that every plebeian
should choose from among the patricians any one whom he pleased as
his Patronus (patron or protector), whose Cliens (client) he was called,
for that (as the Latin name implies) he heard or attended to him. 11
was the part of a Patron to advise and defend his client, to assist him
with his interest and substance, and, in short, to do for him whatever a
parent would do for his children. On the other hand, the client was
obliged to pay the utmost deference to his Patron and to serve him not
only with his means, but even to the extent of his life. This being the
case, it is clear that the salutation of the soldiers of the army of Fabius
as the Patroni of the troops of Minucius was as great a eompliment
as could be paid to them. -salutabitis. This verbis here followed by a

Supply salutm.-plebei scitum ( = plebiscitum). “A decree (or enactment)
of the people.’‘ This name was given to such enactments as were
made in the Comitia Trihuta. Originally they bound only the common-³
or plebeians (plebs); but after the year 13.c. 447 the whole Roman
people. Plebei is gen. of plebes: plebs.—-prz'mus antiquo abrogoque. “I
am the first to annul and abrogate.” Primus often demtos, as here,

to laws, proposals for a law, eta—quod. Observe the position of the
relative clause, for emphasis, before the demonstrative. Quod refers to
the clause sub imperium . . . restittat—jubeas. The second and third
persons of the present, and the third person of the perfect subjunctive
