„116 NOTES To mvr, cAP. xxxix.

emman XXXIX—Id quod. When a clause (as here) forms the
antecedent, id quod is at times used instead of quod alone. In this con-
struction the clause beginning with id quod precedes that to which it
relates. In grammatic-tl strictness id is in apposition to the clause re-
ferred to, while quod relates to ioh—tui. Gen. of pers. pron. dependent

esse—nescio an, followed by subj. (here, pres), means, literally, “ I know
not whether” a person or thing may not do or be that which is denoted
by the verb. By long usage the expression has acquired the force of
‘⁴ perhaps,‘' and, together with the accompanying verb, involves the no-
11011 of a suspicion that the Subject of such verb (be it thing or person)
“is'’ or “will be’' that which is described in the context. Render,
“perhaps this opponent will remain more hostile than that foe.‘’ Hie
adcersarms= Varro : zlle kostis=Hannibal.-pu9nandnm tibi est. “ Yon
