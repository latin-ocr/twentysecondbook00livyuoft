distance to (the eyes of) the consul the greatest devastation he can.n
In order to express the highest possible degree quantus (and qua'm)
are joined to superlatives in connection with a tense of possum, or
sometimes without it. This is, however, an elliptical mode of expression.
The present passage filled up would run thus : consuli procul ostendit
tantam vastitatem, quantam vastitatem potest maximam ostendere.-
ηε quieto quidem hoste. ‘⁶ Not even when the enemy was quiet.” Quieto
hoste. Abl. Abs. [ἐ 125, a].-quieturus. Part. fut. of quiessem—ferri
agique. “Are carried and driven off.” These two verbs are used in
combination in military language to denote plundering in general.
Strictly fero is applicable to things without life, ayo to men and cattle.
—suum id dedecus ratus. “ Having considered this a disgrace to
himself? Lsterally, “ having considered that this disgrace was his
ownl' Fully: ratus id esse suwm dedecus. Here ratus is followed by
objectiva clause. Id refers to the following clause, per mediam . . . .
oppuy‘nanda. The more usual form of expression would be, sibi id
dedecori esse ratus—obsistente nullo. ‘⁴ Without resistance from
any one.'’ Literally‚ “no one opposing.’' Abl. Abs. [ξ 125]. Nullo is
here used as a subse—ad ipsa Romana moenia oppugnanda. “To lay siege
. to the walls of Rome itself.” Literally, “the Roman walls themselves.”
Oppuquanda is a gerundive [ἓ 143].—-cete<ris omnibus, etc. ‘'When all
the rest in the council (ἵζε. of war) recommended things conducive to
safety rather than (those that were) brilliant,'' τῖε. such a course of action
as would tend to the sasety of the state rather than merely lead to
some brilliant or dashing deed. Saluiam and speciosa are both used
ts substantives.

Colleyam exspectandum. Supply esse. “That he must wait for his
colleague.’‘ Lioerally, “that his colleague must be waited for.” Observe
the force of the gerundive in attributive construction [ἓ 144, 2]. From
this point, Oratio Obliqua is used 3 and the Objective clause colleyam (esse)
exspectandum is dependent upon the general notion of “ saying ’‘ involved
in the meaning of suadentibus—levium armorum. “Of light-armed
troops.'' Observe the use of armorum for armatorum ; i.e. of the arms
themselves for those who carried them.—-proedandi. Gerund in di from
proedor, dependent on licentici [ξ 141, 2].—hostem cohibendum. Supply
esse. Compare note above on colleqam exspectandum—Arretii. Gen. of
name of place [ἓ 121, Β, a].—sedeamu.s. “Let us sit,” ir. remain eu-
camped. The first person plur. of the pres. subj. is used at times, as here,
to express a mutual adhortation, in which the speaker includes himself as
well as the person or persons addressed. This is called mejam-timis
adhortativus. Observe that this language of the consul is given in
Oratio Recta, or what are said to be his own words—Hannibal per-
populetur. “Let Hannibal utterly devastatel' Observe the force of
per in this compouud verb. The subjunctive is here used in the force
of the imperative [ἓ (HJ-nec ante uos hinc moverimus, quum . . . .
Patres aec-iverint. ‘· And (though this be so) we will not remove hence,
before that the Fathers shall have summoned.“ Move-imus and acci·
verint are future-perfecte. Observe that when the future-perfect is
used in both the leading and subordinate propositions, the intention is
to indicate that one action will be completed at the same time with t‘ne
other. Flaminius, therefore, here intends that as soon as the Senate
sends for him, he will leave Arretium, but not before. This. however.
