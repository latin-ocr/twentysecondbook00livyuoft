verb of the clause, is also in plur.: see Notes to Syntax, p. 133 F, 1.
In each Roman legion there were six military tribunes, or tribunes οῖ’
the soldiers. Originally they were appointed by the kings, consuls, or
dictatore. In the year Rc. 360 the people assumed the right of annually
appointing six. But in the year Rc. 310 (at which date four legions
were raised year by year), the Lex Atilia was passed, which ordained
that sixteen out of the twenty-four tribuneships which were required
for the new legions should be at the disposal of the people. In times of
great danger to the state all the appointments were usually, however,
placed in the hands of the consuls—armis. Abl. dependent on cacata

“they make a direct march.'’—f<zma erat. “There was a report;”
or, more freely, “it was reported or commonly said.” Here sama
