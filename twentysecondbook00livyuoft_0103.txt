roras 'ro ΜΠ, cn. xi. 91

Sibyllino books were called fatales, as containing a statement of the fatas
οι· foi-tunes of Rome-praetor. When the Consuls, from being continually
engaged in t-he command of armiesin the field, were prevented from attend-
ing to the administration of justice,a magistrate was created for that pur-
pose, B.c. 364, to whom the name of Proetor was assigned. At first he was
taken only from the patricians, as some compensation for the plebeians
being admitted tothe consulship; but in the year 13.e. 335 a plebeian was
made eligible for the Praetorship. The Proetor ranked next to the Con-
suls, and was created with the same auspices. The first Praetor was
Spurius Furius Camillus. As many foreigners flocked to Rome, a second
Praetor was added, ac. 243, for the purpose of administering justice
between them and citizens, and was hence styled Praetor Per-affluas.
*rho other administered justice only between citizens, and hence was
named Proetor Urbanus. After Sicily and Sardinia had been reduced
to the form of a province, B.c. 227, two other Praetors were created to
ι govern them ; and two more were added when Hither and Further

Spain had been subdued, B.c. 199. The Praetors decided by lot, or
agreement, what their jurisdiction or province should be. In dangerous
conjunctures none were exempted from military service.

Gummi XL—Retulit. “Brought forward a motion.'’ The object
of this verb is, here, the clause quibus . . . . emerent—eundum
esse. Impersonal gerundivo construction [ᾖ 144, 1].——censere71t. subj.
in an oblique. or indirect, question [ᾖ 149].—decretum. Supply est.
Impers. pass. verb. Its Subject is the clause, ut . . . . duceret—quan-
tum equitum peditumque. “ As much cavalry aud infantry as.” Quan-
tus is at times, as here, used without a preceding tantas. Equitum is
the gen. of “thing measured ’' after quantum [ξ 131].—ut e Republica
duceret. “ As he considered for the advantage of the state.” The subj.
is used in clauses introduced into a proposition, of which the verb is in
thesubj ..provided the subjunctive clause so introduced belongs essentially
to the preceding one, defining some circumstance, condition, etc. of tha
Subjeet of it. Here duceret is a verb in the subj., belonging to a clause
introduced into a proposition of which the verb is in the subj.‚ viz.
σθεν-ετ ‚· while further the clause in which duceret occurs defines the cir-
cumstances by which the Subject of ayeret (T. Otacilius) was to be
guided in his conduct.

Adjecturum. Supply essa—Servilianum exercitum, “The army of
Servilius.'' Adjectives derived from proper names are frequently found
in the place of a dependent genitive. Here Servilianum= Ser-tilii, the
gen. of Servilius—his Tibur diem ad conveniendum edixit. “ To these
he appointed a day for going to Tibur and there assembling.” Observe
the pregnant construction of conveniendum. Of a similar character are
the following passages: cui (=ea·ercitui) in Etruriam ad conveniendum
diem edi-verat, Livy, Bk. 31, ch. 11 ; reliqui sese in proximas silvas
abdiderunt, Caes. B. G„ Bk. 1, ch. 12.—quibus. Observe that the rela-
tive is placed before the demonstrative clause for the purpose of the
former being brought prominently forward.—uc ii. The demonstra·
tivo pron. ii is here used emphatieally. The repetition of ut is unusual.
As editions vary between ut ii and uti, it is probable that ii is the right
reading, and that ut has either been inadvertently introduced a second
time by some copyist, or else that it has got out of its place and ought
