at a little distance from it, and (as presently shown)considerably further
back. The term αἰῶ generally represents, in the Roman army, the ca·
valry of the allisa, which was usually posted ιιι the wings. Here, how·
ever, the word de'notes infantry stationed on the flank: so Livy speaks
of cohortes alariae at Bk. 10, ch. 4ος and Caesar, at Bell. vyCiv. Bk.
1, ch. 73.-‘prominente acie. Abl. Abs. [5 126].—qm‘ cuneus. “And

relative in this place is necessary, for if the relative had stood
alone it would have pointed ιο some antecedent in the immediately
preceding sentence. —ut pulsus. “When it had been beaten. ’' Supply

line equal to that of the enemy. ” Taken, however, in the present iu·
stance in connection with the following context, it cannot have that
force, but must be rendered as above—dein cedendo. “In the next

Gauls and Spaniards who formed the cuneus. Some editions have

rendered—Afri circa jam cornua fecerant. “The Africans (i.e. the
Carthaginians) (who were) around had by this time formed the wings
(or extremities);” 230. of the Carthaginian infantry. The Gauls and
Spaniards, as previously mentioned, had been posted in the centre con-
siderably in advance of the Carthaginian foot. As, however, the Gauls
and Spaniards kept giving ground, they gradually got further back than
the Carthaginians, by which means the latter became the cornua to
what had previously been the cienena—irruentibusque incaute, etc.
‘⁴ And (when this was the case, then) they wheeled their flanks around
the Romans (who were) rushing heedlessly into the middle.'' circumdo,
followed by Ace. of nearer Object, and Dat. of remoter Object, means,
literally‚ ‘⁸ to place or set one thing round another.” By the above move-
