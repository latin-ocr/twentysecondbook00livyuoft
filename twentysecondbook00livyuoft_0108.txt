Ducebat. The imperf. here marks a continued action: ‘⁴ kept march-
mg? See also note on ducit, ch. 12 ἓ 1.- Geronium. Acc. of place
“ whither'’ [ἓ 101].-waetu. Abl. of cause after desertam [ἐξ 142, 111],
-ayens cum mayzstro equitum, ut. The phrase aqcre cum aliquo implies
“to treat, or speak with or to some one,'' accompanied with the fur·
ther notion of entreating, beseeching, asking, eto. Render, therefore,
“speaking to the master of the horse not merely with authority, but
with advice as well, and beseeching him to? ean-consilio. Dat. de-
pendent on confidat [ἓ 106, (3)].—ne nihil actum censeret. “Not to
think that nothing had been done.'’ Ne belongs to censeret. With actum
supply esse: nihil is its Subject.—esse. The Subject of this inf. is the clause
ab toties . . . respirasse [ξ 156, (3)].-ιίι.ςῖ.ςεε, respirasse. Thes ; are sub-
stantival infinitis-es [ξ 140} After respirasse the construction is broken
off. Apparently, Livy seems to have intended to give some such word
as proficiscitur as the finite verb of the clause in which ayens (= isayens)
would be the Subject. After, however, the long entreaty of the master
of the horse, from utplus to respirasse, he seems to have forgotten the
required structure of the passage, and leaves it unfinished.—koec. Ob-
sorve the use of the acc. of nent: pron. after the pass. (part.) premonitus.

CnAP'rEn XIX—Gerebantur. The imperfect tense here points to a
continued action.—Cartha9ine. Observe the use of the abl. of the name
of a town without-‘1 proposition to denote “whence'' [ξ 121, C].—consilii.
Gen. dependent on idem [ἓ 131].--ιίεΙεείο milite ad naves imposito.
“ When the soldiers which were levied for the ships (ie. for nav-al service)
had been embarked.” Observe that ad naves must be joined to delecto.
In naves frequently follows the verb imponere, but ad naves neven—hosti.
Dat. dependent on adv. obviam-altero ab Tarracone die. “ On the se-
cond day after leaving Tarraco ;'' literally, “ from Tarraco.’' Altero
dieis the abl. of time “when '¹ [ἓ l20].—decem millia passuum distantem.
“ Teu miles distant.'’ Mallia passuum is acc. of “measure of space’' aster
distantem [ἓ 102].—speculatcrioe. ‘⁶ Spy-vessels,” or “vessels of observ-
ation.”-retulers1mt. “Brought back word (or reported).” Observe the
use of speculatorioe instead of the speculatores, who were on them, as the
Subject of this verb. Its Object, is the following clause—stare. ‘⁴ Was
lying (or riding) at anchor.'' Observe this force of sto as a nautica]-
technical term—posita. Supply esse—ut. “ In order that.”—sublati³
ancoris. “ Having weighed anchor.'’ Literally‚ ‘⁸ anchore.’' The plural
is used because the expression applies to all Scipio's vessels. —vadit.
Historic present.—quz'hus et speculis . . . . utuntur. “Which they em-
ploy both as look-out places.'' Observe the use of utor with a double
Abl. ; viz. “ to employ'' something “as‘’ something, or ‘· to have‘' some-
thing “ for ” something. The second Abl. is in apposition with the first
[ἓξ 9ος 119].—aperientibus classem promontoriis. ”The headlauds al-
lowing the fieet to be seen.” Literally, “ uncovering‚” and “ so render·
ing visible.’'—alizcs super alium. “ One after another.” Liberally, ‘⁶ one
on the top of another.’'—-conseendm·e nave-3. “To go on board their
ships.’'—classem, etc. This clause isin Oratio Obliqua, and is dependent.
on a verb of “ saying‚” involved in the meaning of the preceding jubet.
—strepunt. Historic presens—resolutis oris. Abl. Abs. [ἓ 125]. “When
they had cast off their shore—ropes.” Observe the force oforis in this pase-
age, and how it is obtained. The proper meaning of ora is ‘⁸ the berder,
or margin,” ef anything; hence, it implies the “coaet. sea-coast?
