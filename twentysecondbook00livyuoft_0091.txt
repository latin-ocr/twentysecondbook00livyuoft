the Senam and people waited on them at their houses, and conducted
them with great pomp to the Capitol. There they offered vows (vota
nuncupabant), sacrificed each of them an ox to J upiter, and consulted the
Senate about the Latin Holidays and other religious matters. To these

Penates were guardian deities. The public Penates at Rome were those
which AEneas brought with him from Troy. They were worshipped in
the Capitol, and were supposed to have the city and temples under their

festival was observed with great solemnity 011 the Alban Moune, before
the temple of Jupiter Latiaris, to whom an ox was sacri ficed. Till it was
over it was the custom that the Consuls should not set out for their pro-
vinces. 1f in any respect it was not rightly observed, if any part of the
ceremonial was omitted, it was held a second time. Originally it lasted
but one da (27th April), but afterwards for several days—sacrificio in
monte per ecto. ‘⁴ After the sacrifice on the Mount had been performed.''
The sacrifice may here mean either that which was offered on the Alban
Mount, etc. (see note above), or that which the Consuls offered to Jupiter
on taking office on thp Capitoline Hill: see note above on a domo.—
Votis rite, etc. “ After their vows had been duly offered in the Capitol:''

person, only a magistrate duly elected, could take the auspices—nec sine
