PREFAOE.

 

ΙΝ compliance with several requests addressed to the
Publishers the present edition of Book XXII. of Livy

Α “ has been prepared on the plan which the Editor adopted
for Book XXIII.

At the head of each chapter a succinet account of
its contents is placed.

The Notes are occupied with explanations of the
several allusions which occur in the work, and also
with information respecting various grammatical con-
structione. References are largely made to the ‘⁶ Public
Schools Latin Primer,” as being the Grammar now
ordinarily used ; while occasionally‚ where needful, the
rules laid down in the Grammars of Zumpt and Madvig
have been supplied in substance.

After the Notes a Vocabulary of Proper Names is
given. Each article has been written for the elucida-
tion of the Text, and to this point it is strictly confined.

Lormou: August 1875.
