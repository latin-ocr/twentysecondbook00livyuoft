Quo die, etc. ⁸* After he had convened the senate on that day, on
which he entered upon his magistracy (or office).'’ Quo die is put for
oo die. quo (abl. of time ‘⁸ when ” [ξ 120]), so that not only is the
demonstrative omitted before the relative, but further, the subst. (die)
is attracted into the relative clause—quum edocuisset patres plus nequq-
entid . . . . peecatum a 0. Flaminio consule esse. “After he had in-
!ormed the fathers that C. Flaminius, the consul, had miscarried (or
done amiss), more through neglect‚'' etc. Literally, “that it had been
miscarried (or done amiss) by G. Flaminius, the consul? etc. The
ἑ verb edoceo sometimes governs a double acc. ; viz. an acc. of the person,
and an acc. of the information, etc„ given. Here patres is the acc. of
person; the aec. of the informationis represented by the clause plus
, . . consule esse. Peccatum esse is a verb pass. impers. and contains its
Subject in itself. viz. (the subst.) peccatum—essent. Subj. in Oblique
interrogation [ἓ 149].

Quod. The relative clause introduced byquod is placedbefore the demon-
strative. clause (decemviri . . . . juberentur) for the purpose of giving em·
phasis to the statement contained in it.—-quod ejus. All that intervenes
between these words and permansisset is in Oratio Obliqua. Hence the use
of the subj. and inf. moods. Observe, that the relative clause here, else,
precedes the demonstrative clause for the purpose of emphasis. See
preceding note.—votumforct. Impers. pass. verb—id. When, as here,
the demonstrative is emphatic, it is invariably expressed—supplicationem,
lectisternium. See notes on supplicatio, ch. l ἓ 15, and lectisternium,
eh. 1 § 18.—ver sacrum. Literally, ⁴· a sacred spring,'' i.e. a consecra-
tion to the deities, as sacrificial victims, of all the young of swine, sheep,
goats, and neat cattle (see ch. 10) born between the first of March and
the end of April. Among the Samnites the children were included in
this vom—vovendum. Supply essa—si lumnam prospere esset. ‘¹ If
the war shall have been brought to a successful issue.” Literally, ‘¹ if it
shall have been warred prosperously.” Bellatum esset is a verb pass.

q impers. The pluperf. subj. here supplies the place of a future perfect,

the subj. being deficient of this tense. See note on si tradidissent. ch. 6
ξ ll.—quofuisset. ‘¹ In which it had bens—permansisset. Pluperf.
subj. as a future perf. See note on si tradidissent, ch. 6 ἓ 11.

Cum X.—-Pontifex Maximus. The Pontifices formed an order
of priesthood instituted by Numa, which originally consisted of four

rsons. chosen from the patricians. In the year nc. 399, there were
added four others from the plebeians. Their office was to decide causes
relating to sacred things ; and, in cases where there was no written law,
to presel-ibe what they judged to be proper. The chief of them, styled
Pontifex Meu-imus, i.e. “ The highest or chief Pontifex‚” was elected by
the people, while the rest were chosen by the members of the college
uulf, commonly from amongst those who had borne the chief offices of
che mve- consulendum. Supply esse [5 144, 2].—voveri. Impen.
