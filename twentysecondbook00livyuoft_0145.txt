Priscoe . . . . snm-itatis. Gen. of “quality” [5 128] dependent on

quid enim aliud qucim admonendi essetis? Fully, quid enim aliud sac-
iendum esset, quizm ut admonendi essetis? i.e. “ for what else was to be
done than that you should be counselled ?” The ellipse of some portion
of the verb facio (varying according to the construction) with quid aliud
quam is especially to be noticed, as these last words have, by long usage,
come to be equivalent to the English “merely;” so that here the lan-
guage of the Text represents: “For you were merely to be counselled.''
It is to be observed that the subj. (essetis) is used on account of the pre-
sent expression forming an indirect interrogation 5 149] in Latin, while
in English it becomes a direct statement—pree err-ique . . . . oequum
censuerint. ‘⁴ And have thought it right that they should be preferred.'’
Liberally, “and have thought that to be preferred . . . . was rightff’

Atque utinam hoec, etc. ‘¹ And would that these things which 1 am
about ω speak before you, 1 were speaking at Canusium before the army

place, and compare its force as given in preceding note. Aqerem is the
