Viatorem misit, qui consuli nuntiaret. “ Sent an apparitor for the
purpose of telling (or to tell) the eonsu1.’‘ Viatores were officers whose
duty it was to summon persons before the magistrates. Anciently they
were employed to call senators from the country, where they mostly re-
sided, to Rome : hence the name, which literally signifies “ one going along
the vioe, or roads.” Observe the use of qui before a subj. to denote “ a
purpose.'’ The object of nuntiaret is the following clause—sine lictor-
ibus. “ Without (his) lictors.” The Lictors were public servants, who,
to the number of twelve, went in a line before all the superior magis-
trates. They carried on their shoulder a bundle of rods (fasces) bound
together with a thong, in the middle of which an axe (securis) was
placed. He who went “first '’ was eallnd Lictor Primus ‚· the one who
came last, and so was ‘⁵ nearest ” to the magistrate on whom he attended,
was designate-(i Lictor Proximus. Their office was to remove the crowd
out of the way, to see that proper respect was paid to the magistrate,
and to inflict punishment on those who were condemned, by scourging
them first and then beheading them. One other matter may be named,
as it gave rise to the admission of plebeians to the consulate. When a
Consul, or those entitled to have Lictors, returned home, or went on a
risit, &c. to another house, a Lictor knocked at the door with his flascas.
In conformity with this custom, a Lictor of Sulpicius (a Roman noble,
at the time military tribune with consular power) knocked at his door
in the way above mentioned. It so happened that his wife’s younger
sister, who had married a plebeian, was then in his house. She was
s* :ing to the quick at thinking that a similar honour could not be paid
to her own husband,- and‚ on returning home, she so worked upon her
father that, in conjunction with L. Sextius (subsequently the first Pleb-
eian consul), he took measures which resulted in the honour which his
younger daughter so eagerly coveted being opened to those of her. hus-
band's rank in life.
