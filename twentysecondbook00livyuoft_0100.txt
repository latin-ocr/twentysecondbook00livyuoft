Dictator-em dicendum. (Namely)‚ “the appointing a dictator.” Dic-
endwm is here used in gerundlve attraction [ἓ 143].—-nec dictatorem
populus creare poterat. “Nor could the people create a Dictator. A
Dictator was a magistrate appointed in any great emergency of the
Roman State, and invested with absolute power, from which, in the ear-
lier times at least, there was no appeal. Unlike the other magistrates,
he was not elected by the people; but, on the order of the senate, he was
appointed by one of the consuls, after the auspices were taken, and usually
at night. His office lasted for six months, unless he chose to lay it
down. During its continuance, all other magistracies were in abeyance,
except the tribuneship of the commons. The consuls, indeed, continued
to act, but only in subordination to the Dictator, and without being per-
mitted to display any ensigns of authority in his presence. At ch. 14
of Book 23, it is mentioned that a Dictator was not allowed to ride on
horseback without having first asked and obtained the permission of
the people. His being required to do this is generally regarded as origin-
ating in an intention to show that the chief strength of the Roman
army consisted in its infantry. Be this, however, as it may, immediately
a Dictator was created, he nominated a Maqister Equitum, or ‘⁶ Master
ef the Horse.” who took rank next to him, and whose especial office was
to execute his orders and command the cavalry. The first Dictator is
said to have been T. Lartius: the date of his appointment was B.c. 506.
