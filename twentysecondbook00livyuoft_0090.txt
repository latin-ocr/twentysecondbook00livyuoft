Consul. On the expulsion of Tarquin, the seventh and last king of
Rome, Rc. 509, two magistrates were annually chosen and entrusted
with the chief power of the state. All others, with the exception of the
Tribunes of the Commons, were subject to them. They convened the
Senam, assembled the people, and laid before them what they pleased,
and executed their decrees. In the time of war they possessed the su-
preme command. They levied soldiers, appointed the Military Tribunes
in part (part being created by the people)‚ the centurione, and other
officers. The legal age for the attainment of the consulship was sorty-
three; but before it could be held it was requisite to have passed
through the inferior offices of Quaestor, AEdile, and Praetor.1f one of
the Consuls died during office another was appointed (suffectus or sub-
rooatus est)1n his place. Within the city twelve Lictors went before
each of them, alternately, for a month. A public servant, styled Accen-
εἰιε, preceded the other, and the lictors followed him. Great respect was
paid to them. People went out of their way, uncovered their heads,
dismounted from horseback, or rose up as they passed. With the ex-
ception of the regal crown, their' msignia of office were the same as those
of the kings— viz. a Toqa Proeteoeta, a white robe fringed with purple;
a Oua-ule Ghair,· a Scipio Eburneus, i.e. an ivory sceptre or staff; and
twelve Lictors bearing the Fasces.—R0moe. ‘¹ At Rome.” [ἓ 121,

by the people. Hence the term implies “ command as settled by law.”
