eunt. -mille quinqenii. “One thousand five hundred.’¹ In numbers
above one hundred, the larger number precedes either with or without et.
The omission of et resembles the English mode of expression. —lwstimm
Gen. of“ thing distributed,” after mille quinqenti [ξ l30].—facta traditur.
“ 15 reported to have taken place.'' Supply esse with factm—scribentium.
“ Of writers.’' Part. used as suba—habui. ‘⁸ 1 have regarded.” Habui
is here followed by a second aec. (auctorem), pointing out in what light.
the first acc. (Fabium) is to be regarded—captivorum qui Latini nomin-
is essent, sine pretio dimissis. “After having dismissed without ransom
(literally, money) those who belonged to the captives of the Latin race.”

This passage requires attention, as being of a construction not ordinarily
occurring. Relative pronouns which refer back to what precedes can
never, in prose, stand' 111 any other than the first place 111 a clause. But
when relative pronouns refer to something in ademonstrative clause fol-
lowing, they may be placed after a word that is to be marked as empha-
tic. Here captivorum is the emphatic word, and is placed before qui,
that relative pron. referring to iis, to be supplied with dimissis in the fol-
lowing demonstrative clause, according to the usual omission of the de-
monstrative beforearelative. Moreover, captivorum 1s the gen. after essent
[ξ 127], and has ‘nominis dependent on it. Dimissi-s· (iis)' 1s the Abl. Abs. ff
[g 125]. A passage of corres ponding cons struction is found in Cicero's
fourth Oration against V erreS, ch. 54 t—Romam quoe asportata sunt, ad
oedem Honoris et Virtutis videnus (sc. ea). Here Romam, the emphatic
word, stands before the relative quae, which pron. refers to the demon·
strative ea, to be supplied after tidemus.—szwrum. “Of his own men.'

When eum is prefixed to the abl. of a subst. and adj. 111 other cases than
those specified in note above on mayn& eum curci, such abl. cesses to be
‘⁶ the abl. of manner‚” and something is pointed out as added to the action
of the verb, not as indicating the “ manner ” 111 which such action oper-
