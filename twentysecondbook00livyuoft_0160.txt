cia). The Second Punic War arose from
the circumstance of its having been
besieged by Hannibal while it was in
alliance with the Romans. This memor-
able siege is commonly said to have lasted
eight months, during the whole of which
time a determined resistance was made to
the enemy. At length the inhabitants
were reduced to the very extremity of
famine ; and rather than fall into the
hands of Hannibal, they collected all
their valuables in one spot, and, setting
fire to them, threw their wives, their
children, and themselves into the flames,
and perished. This occurred ΒΑ). 218.

command, and advanced to meet Han-
nibal. An engagement soon followed, in
which Scipio was defeated and severely
wounded. Hereupon he retreated, and
took up his quartem at PlacentIa (now
Piacenza), and awaited the arrival of his
colleague Sempronius, whom he had sum-
moned to ln's assistance from Sicily. Sem-
proniuS, on his arrival, found that Scipio
had quitted Placentia, and encamped
upon the banks of the Trebia (now the
Trebbia). As Scipio’s wound still pre-
vented active service in the field, the
whole command of the army now de-
volved on Sempronius; and he, wishing
to secure glory to himself, resolved, in
opposition to the advice of Scipio, to give
battle to Hannibal. The result was the
disastrous defeat of the Romans, who
were obliged to retire within the walls οἱ
