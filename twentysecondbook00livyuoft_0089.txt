Hannibal movit ea· hibernis. “ When Hannibal moved from,⁷’ or “ quitted,
his m'uterquarters.” Quum is joined to the indicative when it connects an
event or statement with a time and circumstances previously mentioned.
In the present power of move0‚ the personal pron. in reflexive force is more
commonly found after it. From Bk. 21, ch. 59, we learn that Hanni-

attempt to cross this range is given in the place above-mentioned.—

with sear. What follows afl'ords an explanation. Hannibal's peril
arose from the endeavours of the Ganls to assassinate him, and these
endeavours caused him ω goin sear of his life—postquam ......
