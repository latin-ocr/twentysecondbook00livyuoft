proverb is mentioned—ipsum institorem mercis. “Himself the agent
‹ =seller) of (his) commodities.’' By ipsum is meant the father of Varro,
and by mercis the commodities in which he dealt, i.e. meat, for he was a.
buteher. As the Romans considered trade dishonourable, except when
extensive, they did not in general keep shops themselves, but employed
slaves or freedmen to trade on their account. These latter persons were
called institores (literally‚ “those who preside over '’ a business).
Varro's father, however, was a butcher, and kept his own shop. person-
ally serving his customers with meat—filioque hoc ipso, ete. ‘⁶ And
thathe employed this very son for the servile offices of his calling.” Hence
it appears that Varro, who had been praetor, and was shortly afterwards
consul, was not only a butcher's son, but had worked originally as a
butcher's boy. Filio is abl. dependent on usum [ἓ 119]. With usum
supply esse.

Roman citizen. See note on sorum, 011 7 g 6. —plaenere Plur on
