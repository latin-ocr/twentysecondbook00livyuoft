mos est. ‘⁴ As the custom is.” See preceding note—sibimet ipsa mortem
consciverat. “Had committed suicide.” Literally, “herself had ad-
judged death to her own self.’' Observe the strengthening force
imparted to the personal pron. by the suffix met.

Scriba pontilicis, quos nunc minores pontifices appellant. “A scribe
(or secretary) of a pontiff, whom they now call the lesser pontiffs.”
Observe the present construction. Sometimes a pron. refers rather to
the sense, than to the grammatica-l form, of that which precedes. In the
present instance a pron. plur. (quos) refers to a subst. in the sing.
(scriba), the idea being transferred to a number of individual objects;
so that quos=quos scribas. Translate: “the secretary of a pontifl',
whom( = which scribes) they now call the lesser pontiffizss' The pontzfices
were instituted by Numa, and were originally four in number, taken
from the patrici-ans. In the year ΒΩ. 299 four plebeians were added to
them. Sylla increased their number to fifteen. In the time of Livy
(nunc) they were divided into quores and Minores, “ the Greater” and
“the Lesser.” With regard to the latter there is a wide diversity of
opinion. The most probable state of the case appears to be this; viz.
that at the time when the real pontiffs began to neglect their duties‚ and
to leave the principal business of their office to be transacted by their
secretaries, it became customary to designate these secretaries pontifices
minores. The verb appellant is here followed by a double Aec.; viz. an
Aee. of nearer Object (quos), and a second Ace. (pontifices) defining it.
Nunc implies the time at which Livy wrote—eo usque . . . ut. “Even

Quos in classem scriptos habebat. “Whom he had enrolled for the
fieet.” Observe the use of a double Ace. after habebat. When, as here,
the second Aee. is a part. perf. pass, the construction is a circumlocution
for the perf. ind. act. of the verb of such participle, attended by the
concomitant notion of the nearer Object being, if a thing, completed or
finished; or, if a person, in a certain state or condition—‘nt urbi preesidi'o
esset. ‘⁶ In order that it might defend the city.'' Literally, “might be
