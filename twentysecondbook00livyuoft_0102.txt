inf. pass—posse. The Subject of this inf. is the clause injussu populi
voveri [ξ 156, (3)].—‘royatuspopulus‚ etc. Supply est. Literally, “ the
people was asked according to these words : ’⁹ i.e. ‘⁴ a law was proposed
to the people in the followmg form.''—velitis, jubeatis. This was the
usual formula with which a proposition submitted to the people was in-
troduced to their notice, when the matter of such proposition was in
Oratio Recta, as here. When, however, it was in Oratio Obliqua, the
imnerf. subj. was used, an instance of which is found at Bk. xxxiii. ch.
44': vellent juberentne senatum decernere, ut, etc. Here supply royo.

legal instrumente, wills, laws, etc. because in them future timeis implied
with reference to their execution or passing. ΑΗ the laws of the 'Evolve
Tables have the obligatory parts of their several enactments in this
tense—sarit, clepsit. Old forms for secent, clepserit, the perf. subj. of

atro die. In Roman civil life those days were termed atr-i (¹‘black¹’)
on which the state had experienced some great calamity. This designa-
tion is said to have arisen from the custom that prevailed among the
Romans of marking every unfortunate day in the calendar with coal.
On all such days it was forbidden to sacrifice, and no new undertaking
was commenced. “ On a (black‚ i.e.) unlucky day.’' Abl. of time

chief duty was to take care of the Sibylline books, and to inspect them
when commanded to do so by the Senate. It belonged also to them to
take charge of such matters pertaining to religion as the public author-
ities confided to their management. In the present instance they were
directed to take superintendence of the lectisternium—pulveraria. See
note on pulvinar, ch. i. ἓ 15. In the present instance two statues were
placed on each of the six couches. The twelve deities whom they repre-
sented were the twelve Dii Majores or Consentes. Their names are oon-
