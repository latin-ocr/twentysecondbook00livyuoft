In the year B.c. 493, the Roman commons, at the instigation of Sicinius,
made a secession to the Mons Sacer, in consequence of the oppression of
the patricians. They would not return till the latter had agreed to
remit the debts of those who were insolvent, to set at liberty those who
had been seized by creditors, and to grant them their own peculiar
magistrates, whose persons should be sacred, to protect their rights. As
these were in the first instance chosen from the Military Tribunes, they
obtained the name of Tribuni, the word plebis being added to denote
their office, and to distinguish them from the other Tribunes. At first
their power was very limited, being confined to the protection of the
commons—the uttering of the word veto (⁴⁶1 forbid ”) being all they
could do. Eventually. however, by successive encroachments they at·
tained to so great a height of power that, in actual authority, they
surpassed all the other magistrates of the Commonwealth.-id enim
