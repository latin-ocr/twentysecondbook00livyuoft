The expression Latinum nomen (“ the Latin race‘’) denotes those
who enjoyed Latin citizenship (jus Latii, otherwise Latinitas),
whereby they were incorporated with the Romans, without, however,
possessing civitas, or the full privileges of a Roman citizen. The Latins
had their own laws, and were not subject to the edicts of the Roman
Praetor. They were not enrolled at Rome, but in their own cities. If
called to Rome to vote, they were not included in any particular tribe,
but used to cast lots to know with what tribe they should vote; while
the consuls had the power of ordering them to leave the city. At first
the Latius were not allowed the use of arms without the order of the
Roman people. Afterwards they served as allies in the Roman army,
and indeed constituted the chief part of its strength. They were not
received into the legions, but formed a separate body of troops. In the
field they were subject to severer discipline than the Roman soldierS‚
being punishable with stripes‚ from which, after the passing of the
Portian Law, B.c. 299, the latter were exempt—auoeilia. “Auxiliary
forces.”—eastrz·s quoque, etc. ‘¹ The Master of the Horse desired that he
should be separated from the camp also; ’⁷ ie. that he should have a

separo is mostly poetical.
