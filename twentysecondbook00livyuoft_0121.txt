h the nom. The force of this tense is almost identical with that
of the imperfect ind.: indeed both of them are at times found in the
same clause. Thus in Sallust, Jug. ch. 42: pars perfugas venere, alii
a· pacatis preda-9 agebant—mare. Historic Inf. Supply aa its
SubJect ii (=Hannibal et Poem'): see preceding note—biennio ante.
‘⁸ Within the previous two years.’‘ The abl. of words which denote a
{pace of time (here biennio), is used both to denote “when'’ 'a thing

a pens, and also. as in the present instance, the time “ within which

it appens. Ante is an adm—eam. Here used to give emphasis to
terribilem—serunt. See note on serunt, ch. 25 5 19.

Cium-nn XXXI.-Transmisit is here a verb nent. “ Crossed over.”
—eoescensionem This subst. occure frequently in Livy, but is rarely
used by other authors—ct ipsorum σθεν. “ Their own territory also.”
—talentia A talent of silver was worth about §3243 153. sterling.—

· erm-mit. “Iandedff’ Literally, ‘⁸ put out,” i.e. from the ships. Populan-

dum aqi-um. Gerundive attraction [5 143].—navales socii. See note on
navalibus sociis, ch. 11 5 7.—cultorum. Gen. dependent on cqentibue

Ad mille hominum, etc. In the historians and post-Augustan writers,
ad is osten joined adverbially to numeral words in the force of “ about,
nearly, almost.” The present passage is probably corrupt. Most edi-
tions, following the MSS.. have amasso, as in the present Text; some
few have amissum (i.e. est), which has been given on conjecture. As-
suming the last-named reading to be correct, ad mille hominum is the
Subject of amissum (est), “ about a thousand men were lost ;” and a
semicolon or colon ought to be placed after it. It would, however, be
an abrupt expression3 while, further, the intervening words would be
without government. Of ad mille homi-tum amisso it need scarcely be
said that. it does not come within the rules of Grammatical construction.
Under these circumstances it appears probable that the solution of the
difficulty must be looked for in connection with mille rather than with
amisso. It is, therefore, suggested that either copyists have inadvert-
ently written an e for i, or that their i has been mistaken for e ; and,
further, that the reading should be nwt mil θ’, but milli, the abl. sing. of
the word when used as a subst, and which, though rare, is yet found
in two Latin writers when quoting an old author. If th¹s view be
adopted, ad milli hominum amisso will be an Abl. Abs, by which all
abruptnese and want of grammatical connection will be removed. The
rendering of the passage will thus be: “Aster that (or when) a thousand
men—-with them Sempronius Blaesus, the quaestor-had been lost, the
fleet,’' etc. It is to be observed that Gaesar, Bell. Gall. Bk. 2, ch. 33,
uses ad in the foregoing force with the Abl. (which is plur. on account
of quatuor, “fouf’): occisis ad hominnm millibus quatuor.—quoestore‚
Abl. in apposition to Sempronio Bloeso. See note on questura, eh. 26
